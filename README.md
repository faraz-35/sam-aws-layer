## Introduction

In AWS Lambda, a layer is a distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes, or other function dependencies. By creating a custom AWS layer, you can package and share common code across multiple SAM applications, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.

This repository provides a starting point for creating your own custom AWS layer. It includes a sample structure and configuration files to help you get started quickly.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (if any).
3. Customize the layer code and configuration files to suit your needs.

## Usage

To use the custom AWS layer in your SAM applications, follow these steps:

1. Package your SAM application using the AWS SAM CLI.
2. Include the custom layer ARN in the `template.yaml` file of your SAM application.
3. Deploy your SAM application using the AWS SAM CLI.

For detailed instructions on how to use AWS Lambda layers with SAM applications, refer to the official AWS documentation.
